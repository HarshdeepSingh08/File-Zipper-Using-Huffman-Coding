This code demonstrates implementation of the Huffman coding algorithm for file compression. Let's go through the code and explain each part:

1. `struct Node`: This structure represents a node in the Huffman tree. It contains the character `Ch`, the frequency of that character `Freq`, and pointers to the left and right child nodes.

2. `struct Compare`: This structure defines the comparison function used for the priority queue. It compares the frequencies of two nodes to implement a min-heap, where the node with the lowest frequency has the highest priority.

3. `CreateNode`: This function creates a new node with the given character, frequency, and left/right child nodes.

4. `Encoding`: This function recursively traverses the Huffman tree and assigns binary codes to each character. The binary codes are stored in the `HuffmanCode` unordered map, where the character is the key and the code is the value.

5. `Decoding`: This function recursively decodes the encoded text using the Huffman tree. It starts from the root of the tree and follows the binary codes in the input string to traverse the tree and print the decoded characters.

6. `BuildHuffmanTree`: This function builds the Huffman tree based on the input text. It calculates the frequencies of each character, creates nodes for each character, and constructs the tree by merging nodes with the lowest frequencies until only one node remains as the root of the tree. It then calls the `Encoding` function to generate the Huffman codes, prints the codes, encodes the input text, and decodes the encoded text.

7. `main`: In the `main` function, a sample input string `s` is provided. The `BuildHuffmanTree` function is called with this input string to perform compression. The Huffman codes, encoded text, decoded text, and compression ratio are printed.

The code demonstrates the basic workflow of Huffman coding for file compression. It builds a Huffman tree based on the frequency of characters in the input text, assigns binary codes to each character, and uses those codes to encode and decode the text. Finally, it calculates the compression ratio by comparing the sizes of the input and encoded text.
